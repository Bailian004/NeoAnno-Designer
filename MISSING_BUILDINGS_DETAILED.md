## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Buildings (Most Important - 30 buildings)
- Essential production chains
- Frequently used in game
- High impact on factory chains

Priority: Aluminium Smelter, Arctic Gas Mine, Arsenal, Assembly Lines

### Phase 2: Specialized Production (25 buildings)
- Advanced crafting
- Chemical plants
- Specialized manufacturing

Priority: Chemical Plants, Artisan's Workshops, Advanced mills

### Phase 3: DLC-Specific Buildings (20 buildings)
- DLC 7-14 content
- Regional variants
- Late-game facilities

Priority: Based on active DLC content in implementation

### Phase 4: Minor Variant Buildings (16 buildings)
- Hacienda variants
- Advanced versions of base buildings
- Lower-priority items

Priority: After core content is complete

## Integration Notes

1. **Reference Data Available**: All 91 buildings have full definitions in `/tmp/factories.json`
2. **GUID Mapping**: Each building has a unique GUID for reference
3. **DLC Association**: Buildings are tagged with their DLC
4. **Production Chains**: Need to extract from reference for each building
5. **Workforce**: Need to map to appropriate tier (14-tier system)
6. **Consumption**: May require new tier support

---

## Next Steps

1. Extract full building definitions from reference (inputs, outputs, workforce amounts)
2. Create TypeScript building definitions for all 91 missing buildings
3. Add to appropriate regional files (old-world.ts, new-world.ts, arctic.ts, enbesa.ts)
4. Update production chain files with extracted data
5. Test production calculations with complete building set

# Anno 1800 Building Reference Guide

This document contains a comprehensive list of buildings, production chains, and infrastructure for Anno 1800.

## ℹ️ Legend & Notes

### 1\. Street Distance (Public Services)

Public service buildings (Marketplaces, Churches, etc.) do not have a hard "on/off" radius. They rely on **Street Distance** (tiles traveled along a road).

- **Dark Green (Full Coverage):** Residents get **100%** need satisfaction.
- **Light Green (Partial/Max Range):** Satisfaction drops linearly from 100% to 0% the further you go.
- **Paved Streets:** Extend the effective range by **~50%**.

### 2\. Module Placement Rules

- **Fields (Crops):** Must be **Contiguous**. They must physically touch the main building or another attached field.
- **Pastures (Animals):** Placed within a **7-tile radius** (ModuleBuildRadius) around the main building. They do not strictly need to touch the main building.
- **Radius (Density):** Buildings like Lumberjacks scan a circular area (e.g., 7 tiles) for natural resources (trees).
- **Hacienda Radius:** Hacienda buildings must be placed within the Hacienda's circle (Max **75 tiles**).

### 3\. Production Notation

- **1t / 30s:** Produces 1 ton of goods every 30 seconds.
- **1x1:** Represents a standard single-tile field module.

## 1\. The Old World

The primary region where your empire begins.
